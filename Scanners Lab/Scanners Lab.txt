Scanners Lab


Scanners are an important tool in Java to read input from different sources. Scanners can read from the console/user input (System.in), from Files, and from strings. Zybooks relies heavily on scanners to read input into variables in their labs. Your TA will introduce how to use them.


How to import the scanner (must be done before declaration and use)
Import java.util.Scanner;


How to declare a scanner:

Scanner nameOfScanner = new Scanner(source of input);


In many of the labs, the scanner will look like this:
Scanner scnr = new Scanner(System.in);


Reading from System.in means that whatever is typed in the user input box in Zybooks, or the console in Eclipse, is used and read by the scanner in your program.


How to read using the scanner:


The scanner has associated methods that access input. Your TA will go over these:
scnr.next();        returns next token
scnr.nextLine();        returns next line
scnr.nextInt();                returns next integer
scnr.nextDouble();        returns next double
scnr.hasNext();         returns boolean based on if scanner has another token


Tasks: 


1. Complete a program with the following steps:
   1. Declare new scanner
   2. Prompt the user to enter first name
   3. Use scnr.next() tor read first name into variable
   4. Repeat b and c with last name instead of first name
   5. Prompt the user to enter their hometown
   6. Read input into variable using scnr.nextLine
* Be careful about using scnr.nextLine. Where is the scnr after reading in the name?
   7. Prompt the user to enter their age
   8. Read input into variable using appropriate types and scanner method
   9. Print out an introduction about the user with the following format as an example.


Hello! My name is Ada Lovelace and I am from London. I am 205 years old.
